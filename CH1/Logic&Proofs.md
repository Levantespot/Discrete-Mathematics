# Logic  and Proofs

## Propositional Logic / Propositional Calculus

**Proposition** (命题) : A proposition is a declarative sentences that is either true or false, but not both.

**Truth Value** (真值) : The true value of a true (or false, respectively) proposition is True (or False, respectively) and denoted by T (or F, respectively).

**Propositional Variables** (or **Sentential Variables**)  are variables that represent propositions, e.g., $p,q,r,s,\cdots.$  

**Compound Propositions** (复合命题) : propositions that are formed from existing propositions using Logical Operations.

### Logical Operations

**Negation Operator** ($\neg$)
